4. Read the `README.md` included with your new website skeleton on how
   to deploy your site

### Cookiecutter items

- `post_deployment_scripts_directory`: the directory where the
  [post-deployment action hooks](https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/Post-Deployment-Action-Hooks)
  are to be stored, e.g. the script to execute `pip` after each site
  deployment
- `requirements_file_name`: the path to the `pip` requirements file,
  e.g. `requirements.txt`
